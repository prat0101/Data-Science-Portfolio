# Project Objective and Data Description

To ensure the safety and reliability of each and every unique car configuration before they hit the road, Daimler’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. But, optimizing the speed of their testing system for so many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.
We need to build an ML model that would predict the testing time for different values of predictor variables to help engineers choose combinations such that it would give minimum time for testing.

## About Data:
Predictor Variables are categorical : X1, X2, X3,X4………X378

The dependent Variable is the time: Continous variable
